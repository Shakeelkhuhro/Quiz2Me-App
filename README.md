# Quiz2Me-App
**Quiz2Me** is a desktop and mobile application that allows users to play quiz games in a user-friendly interface. The app offers three categories of quizzes, namely Computer, Mathematics, and General Knowledge, with the potential for more categories to be added in the future.

One of the unique features of Quiz2Me is its 50-50 lifetime option, which reduces the number of options from four to two, making the quiz more challenging and exciting. The app also includes almost all-in-one subjects, making it a versatile tool for students and professionals alike.

During the development of Quiz2Me, our team learned several new concepts of Java, such as Multi-Threading, Java AWT, Java swing, and AWT event. We also honed our teamwork, leadership, time management, research, and analysis skills.

The Quiz2Me app can be useful for students looking to test their knowledge, professionals seeking to improve their skills or knowledge, and anyone looking for a fun way to challenge themselves. Additionally, the app is easy to use, making it accessible to people of all ages and skill levels.
